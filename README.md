This is a very simple project, using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript; CSS3 being its star.

The goal here is to practice CSS 3 and a bit of JavaScript, by creating styles for a Dark Mode, a Light Mode and a "changer button" and controlling this changing process by a simple script.

A few changes are expected: entire translation into english; addition of commentaries; and refactoring regarding the "BEM" pattern.

If you are learning these languages or are looking for exercises to use with your students, feel free to clone this repository and use it as you will. Suggestions of improvements and even other types of little projects are well appreciated.
